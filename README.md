üöÄ **Introducing a groundbreaking chat application that redefines online communication.** Built with a focus on privacy, security, and user control, this app offers a pioneering approach to chatting, file sharing, and exploring virtual spaces‚Äîall from within your browser.

üîí **Privacy by Design**: Leveraging WebRTC for peer-to-peer connections, our app ensures your conversations and files stay between you and your contacts‚Äîno middlemen involved. With encryption technologies built into modern browsers, we enable users to manage their encryption keys, ensuring unmatched privacy and security.

üåç **Decentralized and Empowering**: Say goodbye to the constraints of traditional server-based apps. Our technology allows for decentralized authentication, encrypted messaging, and even decentralized file transfers. Your data, your rules.

üî• **Feature-Rich Experience**:
- **Secure Messaging**: End-to-end encryption for all messages.
- **File Sharing**: Seamlessly share files with peers using cutting-edge WebRTC technology.
- **Voice and Video Calls**: Connect more personally with high-quality calls.
- **Mixed-Reality Spaces**: Dive into shared virtual environments for a new way of interaction.
- **Image Board**: Share and discover images in a community-driven space.

üëæ **Tech for the Future**: Beyond chat, we're exploring virtual reality, enabling users to share 3D positions and live video streams within VR environments. Imagine socializing in a virtual space that's as easy to access as opening your browser.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites for development

You need to have Node.js installed on your system to run the app. If you don't have Node.js installed, you can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

### Running the app

First, clone the repository to your local machine.

For users that dont want to install anything and just want to try the app locally, you can open the file found at `<root>/Frontend/index.html` in a browser of your choice. 

For NPM users:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

For docker users:

```bash
npm run docker:build # docker build -t chat -f docker/Chat.Dockerfile . --no-cache
npm run docker:run # docker run --name chat-container -p 8080:80 chat
```

This will start the development server and open the app in your default browser. If it doesn't open automatically, you can navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view the app.

> See the [package.json](package.json) file for more scripts.

## Trying it out

Try it out between you phone and laptop. The app is using browser storage, so if you open 2 tabs of the app, they will use and update the same data. This can lead to conflict issues and should be avoided. instead if you want to try on your device, you can try between different browsers (like chrome and edge). Its also worth noting that incognito modes on all the browsers would also use a different store.

## iOS, Android and Desktop

The app can be installed on iOS, Android and Desktop. The project is not mature enough to be published on the app stores ([exception](https://store.app/chat-staging-positive-intentions-com)?). This repository has the necessary files to build the app for these platforms. This should be done by someone with experience in building apps for these platforms.

### iOS and Android

To build for mobile, you need to have respective build tools installed on your computer (xcode/android studio) installed on your system. the build is created with capacitorjs found [here](https://capacitorjs.com/). See the folders `ios` and `android` in the root folder for the build files.

### Desktop

To build for desktop, you need to install the dependencies with the `npm i` command, then you may also need to install rust on your system as described [here](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites/). The desktop build is based on Tauri found [here](https://tauri.app/). You can create a build by running `npm run tauri build`. the build will be found in the `tauri/target/release/bundle` folder (you may need to add executable permissions `chomod +x <filename>`).


### Join Us on This Journey

Pushing the boundaries of what's possible with current web technologies to create a chat app that prioritizes user empowerment and privacy. But this is just the beginning. With your support, we can explore new features, refine the user experience, and expand the app's capabilities.
