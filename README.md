## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites for development

You need to have Node.js installed on your system to run the app. If you don't have Node.js installed, you can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

### Running the app

First, clone the repository to your local machine.

For users that dont want to install anything and just want to try the app locally, you can open the file found at `<root>/Frontend/index.html` in a browser of your choice. 

For NPM users:

```bash
npm install

```

For docker users:

```bash
npm run docker:build # docker build -t chat -f docker/Chat.Dockerfile . --no-cache
npm run docker:run # docker run --name chat-container -p 8080:80 chat
```

This will start the development server and open the app in your default browser. If it doesn't open automatically, you can navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view the app.
